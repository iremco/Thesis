* Evaluation Metrics Used in State of the Art

- Frechet Inception Distance (FID, lower is better) 
- Inception Score (IS, higher is better)
- Structural similarity index measure (SSIM, higher is better)
- Peak signal-to-noise ratio definition (PSNR, higher is better)

** Coco

** SpiralNet
*** FID

** Big Gan
*** FID 
*** IS
- FID/IS values at the truncation setting whichattains the best FID
- FID at the truncation setting for which our modelâ€™s IS isthe same as that attained by the real validation data
- FID at the maximum IS achieved by each model, to demonstrate how much variety must be tradedoff to maximize quality.
